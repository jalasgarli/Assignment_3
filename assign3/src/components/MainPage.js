            <h3>Javid Alasgarli: </h3>
            <p>I am a dedicated Computer Science student at ADA University, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree.
                My expertise lies in competitive programming,
                where I have demonstrated a strong ability to solve complex algorithmic problems
                and consistently rank in the top percentiles in regional coding competitions.
                Additionally, I am proficient in web development, excelling in both frontend and backend technologies.
                I have successfully designed and developed multiple functional and visually appealing websites using languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
                I also developed backend systems and microservices. At the moment I am CTO of CodeAny (codeany.org).
