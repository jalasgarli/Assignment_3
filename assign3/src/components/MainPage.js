            <h3>Javid Alasgarli: </h3>
            <p>I'm a final year computer science student at ADA University, and I had the opportunity to be an exchange student 
                at Texas A&M International University. As a backend developer intern at the Ministry of Finance, 
                I gained practical experience and applied my skills in a real-world setting. 
                Currently, I'm working on my final year project, which involves creating a final exam scheduler for ADA University.
             This project not only integrates my academic knowledge but also addresses a practical need within the university.
             I'm excited about contributing to the optimization of the examination scheduling process through innovative technology.
